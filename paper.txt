Abstract
Synthetic lethality (SL) is a genetic interaction phenomenon where the concurrent inactivation of two genes results in cell death, while the inactivation of either gene alone does not. This concept has been harnessed to develop innovative cancer treatments, with PARP inhibitors exemplifying the clinical success of SL-based therapies. Despite advancements in large-scale loss-of-function screenings, such as CRISPR, the reproducibility of synthetic lethality across multiple studies remains limited, and many SL gene pairs appear to be highly cell-line specific. In response to these challenges, we introduce RobSL, a computational tool designed to identify robust synthetic lethal gene pairs across diverse cell lines and loss-of-function techniques. RobSL integrates large-scale functional loss data from cancer cell lines with multi-omics data, thereby enhancing the robustness and reproducibility of SL gene pair identification. Furthermore, RobSL incorporates drug response data, providing insights into potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment. The primary objective of RobSL is to advance the application of synthetic lethality in cancer therapy by improving the identification and understanding of synthetic lethal gene pairs.

\section{Introduction)
Synthetic lethality (SL) is a biological phenomenon where the simultaneous inactivation of a pair of genes results in cell death, while the inactivation of either gene alone does not significantly affect cell survival (Figure 1)(setton_synthetic_2021). This concept has been leveraged by Hartwell et al. (hartwell_integrating_1997) to propose an innovative approach to cancer therapy, utilizing synthetic lethal gene pairs to selectively target and kill cancer cells. The strategy involves identifying a mutation specific to a cancer cell and targeting its synthetic lethal partner. This approach allows for the selective eradication of cancer cells without significant impact on the survival of normal cells, thereby offering novel therapeutic possibilities for cancers previously difficult to treat with drugs.  
The concept of synthetic lethality has been successfully applied in cancer therapeutics, most notably with the use of PARP inhibitors in treating cancers linked to BRCA mutations (ashworth_synthetic_2008). BRCA1 and BRCA2, both tumor suppressor genes, play crucial roles in DNA repair mechanisms and, to date, have no direct targeted therapies. Mutations in these genes render cancer cells dependent on alternative DNA repair pathways, such as those facilitated by PARP enzymes. By exploiting this dependency, PARP inhibitors can selectively eradicate BRCA-mutated cancer cells, sparing healthy cells. This innovative strategy has shown promising outcomes in clinical trials, leading to the approval of PARP inhibitors for the management of breast and ovarian cancers (lord_parp_2017). 
While PARP inhibitors have shown promise, the full potential of synthetic lethality in cancer treatment remains untapped, with only PARP inhibitors having reached the clinical application stage. This is primarily due to the complexity and cellular heterogeneity of cancer. The identification of clinically relevant synthetic lethal gene pairs faces three major challenges: i) The current discoveries of synthetic lethal gene pairs rely on high-throughput gene loss-of-function screens conducted in specific cancer cell lines. These screens emphasize the lethality of gene inactivation on cancer cells while often neglecting the limited cytotoxicity towards normal cells. Consequently, this biased focus on cancer cell killing hampers the translational potential of identifying therapeutic strategies. ii) The reproducibility of synthetic lethal gene pairs is limited, with few pairs being consistently identified across multiple studies. In the study conducted by Shen et al. (shen_combinatorial_2017), only eight synthetic lethal (SL) gene pairs were found to overlap between the A549 and HELA cell lines. Upon exploring SynLethDB (guo_synlethdb_2016,wang_synlethdb_2022), the most comprehensive database for synthetic lethal genes to date, we found that in the latest version, SynLethDB 2.0 (wang_synlethdb_2022), out of 35,943 SL records from 417 studies across 294 cell lines, a mere 137 synthetic lethal (SL) gene pairs were replicated in two or more studies. This lack of reproducibility may be attributed to loss-of-function technical issues, such as false positives resulting from inefficient gene targeting reagents (Kaelin, 2012), and cellular heterogeneity (liany_predicting_2020). iii)  Instances of synthetic lethality within cells are infrequent, and the identified synthetic lethal partners often lack targeted therapeutics. Alternatively, when targeted drugs do exist, they often have multiple gene targets, complicating the assessment of their impact on normal cells. Furthermore, achieving cancer cell death may require high drug dosages, posing a risk of drug overdose. Current synthetic lethality research often focuses on the identification or computation of synthetic lethal gene pairs, overlooking the original intent of this research: to explore the potential for new therapeutic strategies. This focus on gene pair identification, while important, should not overshadow the ultimate goal of translating these findings into viable treatment options. 
In response to these three major challenges, we propose RobSL, a novel computational approach designed to identify robust synthetic lethal gene pairs. We define robust synthetic lethal gene pairs as those that exhibit limited lethal affect towards normal cells, possess targeted therapeutics, hold potential for clinical translation, and can be replicated across multiple screenings and diverse cellular environments. Furthermore, we have developed a web application that integrates SynLethDB (wang_synlethdb_2022), protein-protein interaction networks, gene-gene interaction networks, drug target data, drug response data, and relevant visualization tools. This comprehensive platform aims to assist cancer researchers in identifying robust synthetic lethal gene pairs with significant clinical translational value.

\section{Results)
\subsection{RobSL Outperforms Previous Methods in Identifying Known Synthetic Lethal Gene Pairs)
Our RobSL method identifies a greater number of known synthetic lethal (SL) gene pairs compared to previous computational pipelines. Moreover, RobSL's integrated scoring system, which combines scores from both CRISPR and RNAi, outperforms methods relying on a single loss-of-function technology in identifying known SL pairs. 
To evaluate RobSL's capability in identifying synthetic lethal (SL) gene pairs, we selected three genes—BRCA1, BRCA2, and ERBB2—that are known to have numerous synthetic lethal partners in breast cancer. We applied RobSL to screen for synthetic lethal gene pairs involving these genes. Additionally, we selected the BRAF gene, prevalent in skin cancer, for screening to assess the performance of RobSL across different cancer types. We employed four distinct methods to screen and rank potential synthetic lethal (SL) pairs: 1) RobSL, our proposed tool; 2) CancerGD (bridgett_cancergd_2017), a computational pipeline that also utilizes large-scale loss-of-function data to identify synthetic lethal genes; and two other methods that exclusively use either CRISPR or RNAi data. We then counted the number of identified SL pairs in the top 25, 50… and up to 300 pairs that were also present in the SynLethDB database (wang_synlethdb_2022), indicating their identification in at least one previous SL study. As shown in (Figure2 A), RobSL consistently identified more known SL pairs across all top percentages compared to the CancerGD method. Furthermore, when screening for SL pairs for BRCA1, ERBB2 and BRAF, RobSL identified more known SL pairs than methods using only CRISPR or RNAi. For BRCA2, RobSL identified slightly fewer known SL pairs than the CRISPR method in the top 150 pairs but surpassed it beyond the top 150. This discrepancy is likely due to the significant differences between the CRISPR and RNAi results. In the top 150 pairs for BRCA2, CRISPR identified an average of 2.5 more known SL pairs than RNAi, while the difference was less than 0.5 for BRCA1 and ERBB2. RobSL balances the results from both technologies, demonstrating its ability to identify more reproducible SL pairs when the results from different technologies are similar, and to balance the results when the differences are larger. We subsequently analyzed the relationship between the rank of synthetic lethal gene pairs, based on the SL Score computed by RobSL, and their representation in the SynLethDB database. We quantified the proportion of gene pairs within varying percentile ranks (e.g., top 1%, top 2%, top 3%, through to the entire dataset) that are also present in SynLethDB. Our findings indicate a decreasing trend in the proportion of known synthetic lethal gene pairs as the percentile rank increases (Figure2 B). This suggests that the SL Score generated by RobSL effectively reflects the synthetic lethality relationship between genes and is consistent with previous research findings. This trend further underscores the ability of RobSL to prioritize gene pairs that are more likely to exhibit synthetic lethality, thereby enhancing the efficiency of potential therapeutic target identification.

\subsection{Robust Synthetic Lethal Gene Pairs Exhibit Closer Distances in Protein-Protein Interaction Networks)
To explore potential characteristics of the identified synthetic lethal (SL) gene pairs, we integrated the STRING protein-protein interaction database (szklarczyk_string_2015) and calculated the shortest path distances between gene pairs within the protein-protein interaction network. We found that robust SL gene pairs (SL Score > 0.65) exhibited significantly shorter network distances compared to non-robust SL gene pairs (SL Score < 0.65). Furthermore, as we sorted the results based on SL Score and calculated the average shortest path length in the Protein-Protein Interaction Network for varying percentile ranks, we observed an increase in the average distance with increasing percentile rank (Figure2 C). This suggests that gene pairs whose protein products physically interact are more likely to exhibit robust SL interactions. This finding is consistent with previous studies that robust genetic interactions are enriched in protein interaction pairs (roguev_quantitative_2013,han_synergistic_2017,lord_integrative_2020), further validating our results. 

\subsection{RobSL: A Web Tool to Identify Robust Synthetic Lethality)
In order to explore the intricate dynamics of cancer biology and identify potential therapeutic targets, we have developed a network-based tool known as RobSL. The home page (Figure3 A) provides a clear overview of the tool's capabilities. Within the RobSL interface (Figure3 B), users are guided to select the type of driver gene alteration and the range of gene pairs to be screened based on their understanding of the cancer under study. This process generates two result files: one detailing the SL Score of gene pairs at different fusion proportions (Figure3 B5), and another presenting a comprehensive SL Score for each gene pair (Figure3 B6). To further enhance the utility of the results, users can upload a file containing the SL composite score to the annotation page (Figure3 C), which combines data from SynLethDB, the PPI network, the drug database, and drug response data to provide a richly annotated results file (Figure3 C7, Figure3 C8). Finally, the Result Visualization page (Figure3 D) allows users to visualize the results, analyze trends observed in the existing synthetic lethality database and PPI network, construct a drug network using the drug database, and identify drugs that target multiple synthetic lethal partners. The Synthetic Lethality – Drug Network (Figure3 E) provides a visual representation of the synthetic lethal gene pairs with available drug response data, highlighting drugs exhibiting significant synthetic lethal effects and distinguishing between known and newly discovered gene synthetic lethal pairs. In summary, RobSL is a comprehensive tool that enables users to explore the synthetic lethality landscape of various cancers, providing valuable insights that could guide the development of targeted cancer therapies.


\subsection{Exploring Synthetic Lethality Gene Pairs in Breast Cancer)
Our initial focus was on breast cancer, specifically targeting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are the most common genes implicated in both breast and ovarian cancers. Mutations in these genes account for 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases (mehrgou_importance_2016). We applied RobSL to screen for synthetic lethality gene pairs in breast cancer cells with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Many of the robust synthetic lethality gene pairs identified by RobSL have been reported in previous studies. The most notable synthetic lethality gene pair in breast cancer is BRCA1 and PARP1 (lord_parp_2017), which was also identified in our RobSL screening as a synthetic lethality partner for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Furthermore, by integrating drug response data to construct a Synthetic Lethality - Drug network using RobSL, we identified niraparib as having significant potential for clinical translation (P<0.05). This aligns with previous research, which demonstrated that niraparib significantly improved clinical outcomes in patients lacking BRCA1/2 mutations (kim_alternate_2021,turner_niraparib_2021,gonzalez-martin_niraparib_2022). This overlap validates the robustness and clinical relevance of our RobSL approach. In addition to the well-known BRCA1-PARP1 pair, RobSL identified several other known synthetic lethality gene pairs, including BRCA1-POLE (hall_periosteal_1985), BRCA1-AURKA (srihari_inferring_2015), BRCA1-CDK6 (militello_mechanism_2019,hall_periosteal_1985), and BRCA2-MYC (luoto_tumor_2010). These findings further underscore the utility of RobSL in uncovering clinically relevant synthetic lethality gene pairs in cancer.
Beyond BRCA1/2, we extended our synthetic lethality screening to breast cancer cells with HER2 (ERBB2) amplification and PTEN loss-of-function mutations. HER2 amplification is observed in up to 20% of breast cancers and is linked to an aggressive phenotype (gajria_her2-amplified_2011). However, patients do not always respond as expected to HER2-targeted therapies, leading to potential relapse or non-responsiveness (de_melo_gagliato_mechanisms_2016). PTEN protein expression is significantly reduced in 25-37% of all breast tumors, particularly in those expressing/amplifying HER2 (sajjadi_combined_2021). Low PTEN expression correlates with larger tumor size, advanced pathological stage, and lower 2-year disease-free survival rates (zhang_pten_2013). By exploring synthetic lethality in HER2 and PTEN, we aim to develop improved therapeutic strategies.
In ERBB2 synthetic lethality pairs, only four pairs had drug response data (Figure4 A). We found that ERBB2 amplified breast cancer cells are sensitive to ERBB2 inhibition, reflecting oncogene addiction (lord_integrative_2020). Three ERBB2-targeting drugs, afatinib, BMS-536924, and CP-724714, were identified as having significant potential for clinical translation (P<0.05). Afatinib, in particular, has shown promising activity in HER2-positive breast cancer (hurvitz_afatinib_2014). Hickish et al.(hickish_afatinib_2022) reported that 18% of patients showed an objective response, i.e., a significant reduction in tumor volume, to afatinib monotherapy. This response rate increased to 31% when afatinib was combined with vinorelbine or paclitaxel. Our Synthetic Lethality - Drug Network revealed that vinorelbine and paclitaxel, which target TUBB43, TUBB2A, TUBB4B, and MAP4, could be combined with afatinib. TUBB4B is a synthetic lethal partner of BRCA1, while TUBB2A, MAP4, and TUBB3 are synthetic lethal partners of BRCA1 and PTEN, respectively. Docetaxel showed more significant synthetic lethality selectivity in RobSL, and previous studies have shown its effectiveness in treating breast cancer patients (lyseng-williamson_docetaxel_2005), despite being associated with Epiphora (hyperlacrimation) and other adverse events (stoicescu_docetaxel_2021). In addition to ERBB2 itself, PIK3CA was identified as a robust synthetic lethal partner, with two drugs, Alpelisib and gsk2126458 (omipalisib), showing significant therapeutic potential (P<0.05). Both drugs have demonstrated antitumor activity in previous studies (andre_alpelisib_2019,wilhoit_alpelisib_2020,basu_dual_2018). In PTEN synthetic lethality pairs, we identified PIK3CB as a new synthetic lethal partner for PTEN. While PTEN-PIK3CB is not listed in SynLethDB, previous studies have shown that PTEN mutant cell lines are more sensitive to inhibition of the PIK3CB (wee_pten-deficient_2008,lord_integrative_2020). Furthermore, the PIK3CB-targeting drug, gdc-0941 (pictilisib), has demonstrated antitumor activity in previous research (schoffski_phase_2018).

\subsection{Exploring Synthetic Lethality Gene Pairs in Melanoma)
We further investigated synthetic lethality in melanoma, the most aggressive type of skin cancer with high mortality rates (naves_nanotechnology_2017). Our focus was on cells with gain-of-function mutations in BRAF, a serine/threonine protein kinase that activates the MAP kinase/ERK-signaling pathway. Approximately 50% of melanomas harbor activating BRAF mutations (ascierto_role_2012), which have been associated with poor prognosis and increased invasiveness (lu_oncogenic_2016). Our synthetic lethality screening identified 215 gene pairs in BRAF mutant cells. Consistent with the concept of oncogene addiction, these cells were sensitive to BRAF inhibition. While BRAF inhibitors have shown objective tumor responses in about half of the patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, the duration of these responses is often limited due to acquired resistance (eroglu_combination_2016). This underscores the value of developing new therapeutic strategies based on synthetic lethality.
Many of the identified synthetic lethal effects involving BRAF can be explained by its role in the MAPK pathway. For instance, MAP2K1 (MEK1) and MAPK1 (ERK2), downstream effectors of BRAF in the MAPK pathway, were identified as synthetic lethal partners. Activation of the MAPK pathway has been linked to immune evasion in melanoma cells (sumimoto_brafmapk_2006,leung_hyperactivation_2019). Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition has been shown to be superior to BRAF inhibition alone in terms of therapeutic efficacy and side effects (eroglu_combination_2016). In addition to these known interactions, our screening identified several potential new synthetic lethal partners for BRAF (Figure4 B). These include BRAF-PEA15, where BRAF mutations have been shown to increase sensitivity to PEA15 inhibition (formstecher_pea-15_2001,herrero_small_2015,lord_integrative_2020), BRAF-MDM2, with recent research suggesting that MDM2 inhibitors can inhibit melanoma growth in vivo (ingelshed_mdm2_2022), and BRAF-BIRC5, where survivin (BIRC5) targeting has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and promote apoptosis in melanoma (grossman_inhibition_2001). Despite limited drug response data, we identified bosutinib, a MAP2K1-targeting drug, as having significant potential for clinical translation (P<0.05). Previous research has also confirmed that bosutinib can induce cell death in melanoma (noguchi_bosutinib_2018).

\section{Discussion)
In this paper, we introduce RobSL, an interactive tool designed to identify robust synthetic lethal gene pairs. This tool offers promising therapeutic targets and novel treatment strategies. Unlike previous methods that rely on a single technology, RobSL integrates loss-of-function data from both CRISPR and RNAi, aiming to identify more robust synthetic lethal gene pairs. Furthermore, it considers the impact of targeting synthetic lethal partners on cells without driver gene alterations, striving for more precise therapeutic outcomes. RobSL outperforms previous computational methods in identifying known synthetic lethal gene pairs.
Through exploration in breast cancer and melanoma cells, RobSL not only identified known synthetic lethal gene pairs but also uncovered novel ones with research potential, such as PTEN-PIK3CB and BRAF-PEA15. These findings, supported by previous studies, suggest potential research and clinical translation value of these newly discovered synthetic lethal gene pairs. Consistent with previous research, we found that robust synthetic lethal genes tend to interact directly in protein interaction networks (roguev_quantitative_2013,han_synergistic_2017,lord_integrative_2020). We also observed the phenomenon of oncogene addiction, where cancer cells with oncogenic mutations are sensitive to oncogene inhibition. However, treatment with inhibitors alone may lead to drug resistance. By integrating drug response data with RobSL, we identified potential combination therapies, such as the combination of Afatinib (targeting ERBB2) with vinorelbine or paclitaxel (targeting TUBB43, TUBB2A, TUBB4B, MAP4), which resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving objective tumor responses (hickish_afatinib_2022).
In this study, we only explored synthetic lethal gene pairs driven by a subset of driver genes in breast cancer and melanoma. Due to the limited amount of drug response data, the identified drugs with potential for clinical translation may not necessarily be effective. Some drugs may have multiple gene targets, complicating the prediction of drug responses. Cancer researchers need to leverage their understanding of cancer and conduct further studies and experimental validations based on these findings. We plan to enhance RobSL by adding more loss-of-function and drug response data in the future. Ultimately, we hope that RobSL, with its user-friendly access and interface, will assist researchers in developing more effective and precise cancer treatments.

\section{Methods and Materials)
\subsection{Data Availability and Convergence of CRISPR and RNAi Loss-of-Function Scores)
The CRISPR loss-of-function data was sourced from the DepMap project's Q4 2022 release, available on their website (https://depmap.org/portal/download/). RNAi loss-of-function data was obtained from the DEMETER V2 project (tsherniak_defining_2017,mcfarland_improved_2018), also accessible via the DepMap portal. Multi-omics data, encompassing somatic mutations, gene expression, and copy number variations, were derived from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia CCLE (ghandi_next-generation_2019). All data were harmonized to a common sample naming format (DepMap ID). 
To evaluate the impact of both CRISPR and RNAi technologies on cells, we adopted a weighted fusion approach. The fused score, $Score \theta = \theta \cdot Score_{RNAi) + (1-\theta) \cdot Score_{CRISPR)$, where $\theta$ represents the proportion of the RNAi dependency score. We considered five mixing ratios for $\theta \in (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)$. The RNAi dataset encompassed 705 cell lines, while the CRISPR dataset included 1078 cell lines. Consequently, some cell lines had only CRISPR or RNAi scores. Therefore, in calculating the fused score, we only considered the 539 cell lines common to both datasets. However, when using only RNAi or CRISPR data, we utilized scores from all cell lines within the respective dataset.

\subsection{Calculation of Synthetic Lethality Score for Gene Pairs)
The synthetic lethality score for a gene pair was computed based on three evaluation metrics: DriverGene-Induced Dependency Score Disparity (DGDS Disparity), Cancer Cell Lethal Effect (CCLF), and Non-cancer Cell Lethal Effect (NCLF). These metrics, each ranging from 0 to 1, correspond to our three requirements for synthetic lethality gene pairs. DGDS Disparity measures the disparity in cell viability induced by driver gene alterations upon target gene knockdown. This metric reflects our desire for synthetic lethality gene pairs to selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells, with a substantial degree of disparity. CCLF assesses the lethality effect on cancer cells with driver gene alterations following target gene knockdown. This metric emphasizes the ability to cause cell lethality. NCLF evaluates the lethality effect on cells without driver gene alterations upon target gene knockdown. This metric focuses on minimizing the impact on normal cells, aligning with the goal of precision therapy. 
The DGDS Disparity is composed of three values: the Common Language Effect Size (CLES), Hedges' g, and the p-value from the Mann-Whitney U test. The CLES, equivalent to the Area under the ROC curve and the Probability of Superiority, indicates the likelihood that cancer cells with driver gene alterations are more susceptible to lethality upon target gene knockdown compared to wild-type cells. This metric was used by CancerGD (bridgett_cancergd_2017) for synthetic lethal gene pair identification. However, CLES primarily focuses on the rank order of the data, and may not fully capture the magnitude of the difference between the two groups. Therefore, we incorporated Hedges' g as an additional metric. 
$$
\text{Hedges' ) g = \frac{\bar{X)_{\text{WT)) - \bar{X)_{\text{Altered))){\sqrt{\frac{(n_{\text{Altered))-1) \cdot \text{Var)(X_{\text{Altered))) + (n_{\text{WT))-1) \cdot \text{Var)(X_{\text{WT)))){n_{\text{Altered)) + n_{\text{WT)) - 2))) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{3){4 \cdot (n_{\text{Altered)) + n_{\text{WT)))-9)\right)
$$
${\overline{X))_{\mathrm{Altered))$ and ${\overline{X))_{\mathrm{WT))$ are the mean dependency scores of the altered and wild-type groups, $n_{\mathrm{Altered))$ and $n_{\mathrm{WT))$ are the sample sizes. Hedges' g is a measure of effect size that provides an estimate of the absolute difference between two groups, taking into account the sample size and variance. It is commonly used in meta-analysis and provides a standardized measure of the difference between groups (larson_effect_2018), making it a valuable supplement to CLES for assessing synthetic lethality.  The calculation of DGDS Disparity is as follows:
$$
\text{DGDS Disparity)=\frac{\mathrm{Hedges'g) + \mathrm{CLES)){2) - \alpha \cdot \operatorname*{max)(Pval-0.05,0)
$$
In this equation, the last term serves as a penalty for instances where the p-value exceeds 0.05. This penalty ensures that the DGDS Disparity score is adjusted downwards for gene pairs where the difference in lethality between cancer cells with driver gene alterations and wild-type cells is not statistically significant. This adjustment is crucial to avoid overestimating the synthetic lethality of gene pairs based on effects that may have arisen due to chance. The calculation of CCLF (Cancer Cell Lethal Effect) is defined as follows:
$$
{\mathrm{CCLF))=1 - {\frac{\sum_{i=1)^{n)e^{-\alpha\cdot(X_{i)^{Altered)-0)^{2))){n_{Altered)))
$$
This formula quantifies the lethality effect of gene knockdown in cancer cells with driver gene alterations. It is designed to capture the extent to which the targeted gene's inhibition leads to a decrease in cell viability in cancer cells with specific driver gene alterations. On the other hand, the calculation of NCLF (Non-cancer Cell Lethal Effect) is given by:
$$
\mathrm{NCLF)=\frac{\sum_{i=1)^{n)e^{-\alpha\cdot\left(X_i^{WT)-0\right)^2)){n_{WT))
$$
This formula measures the lethality effect of gene knockdown in cells without driver gene alterations, essentially representing the impact on normal or wild-type cells. The aim here is to minimize the effect on these cells, thereby enhancing the precision of the treatment. In both formulas, the exponential term serves to emphasize the impact of larger differences in cell viability, thereby ensuring that the scores are sensitive to the magnitude of the effect. 
The final synthetic lethality score is a weighted sum of these three metrics. In our RobSL approach, we assigned weights of 0.4, 0.4, and 0.2 to DGDS Disparity, CCLF, and NCLF, respectively. Users can adjust the weights based on their specific needs. Given that gene knockdown can sometimes impact the viability of cells, including those that are non-cancerous, we have slightly reduced the weight of NCLF in our scoring system. This adjustment acknowledges the inherent cytotoxic effects of gene knockdown strategies, which can inadvertently affect normal cells. By reducing the weight of NCLF, we aim to prioritize gene pairs that exhibit strong synthetic lethality (high DGDS Disparity and CCLF) while still considering the potential off-target effects on normal cells (NCLF). This approach allows us to balance the need for effective cancer cell targeting with the goal of minimizing collateral damage to normal cells, thus enhancing the potential therapeutic window for synthetic lethal strategies.

\subsection{Calculation of the comprehensive synthetic lethality score)
To generate a comprehensive synthetic lethality (SL) score for each gene pair, we integrate the SL scores obtained at different proportions of dependency scores from different technologies. The final SL score for a gene pair is computed as follows:
$$
\mathrm{Final\ SL\ Score)=Max\left(\mathrm{SL\ Score)\right)-\alpha\cdot\frac{1){n)\sum_{i=1)^{n)\left|\mathrm{SL\ ){\mathrm{Score))_i-\overline{\mathrm{SL\ Score))\right|
$$
In this formula, $Max\left(\mathrm{SL\ Score)\right)$ represents the highest SL score obtained for the gene pair across different proportions of dependency scores. The second term, $\alpha\cdot\frac{1){n)\sum_{i=1)^{n)\left|\mathrm{SL\ ){\mathrm{Score))_i-\overline{\mathrm{SL\ Score))\right|$, serves as a penalty term that accounts for the variability in SL scores across different proportions. The parameter $\alpha$ is a constant that determines the weight of the penalty term. This approach ensures that the final SL score not only captures the maximum potential synthetic lethality effect observed across different proportions but also penalizes gene pairs with high variability in SL scores, thereby favoring gene pairs with consistent synthetic lethality effects across different proportions.

\subsection{Identifying potential therapeutic drugs with synthetic lethality)
In order to identify potential therapeutic drugs with synthetic lethality, we integrated drug response data from the study by (iorio_landscape_2016,picco_functional_2019). For each drug targeting synthetic lethal partners, we calculated the Half Maximal Inhibitory Concentration (IC50) for each cancer cell line selected by the user. IC50 is a quantitative measure that indicates the dose of a specific drug required to inhibit a given biological process or component by 50% in vitro. We employed the four-parameter dose-response model to estimate IC50 (prinz_hill_2010). The model is defined as follows:
$$
f\left(dose\right)=\mathrm{Bottom)+\frac{\left(\mathrm{Top-Bottom)\right)){1+\left(\frac{\mathrm{IC50)){dose)\right)^{HillSlope))
$$
In this model, 'Top' and 'Bottom' represent the maximal and minimal values of the response curve, respectively, corresponding to the plateaus of the curve in the units of the Y-axis. 'HillSlope' denotes the steepness of the sigmoidal curve. Following the calculation of IC50 values, we proceeded to compare the IC50 of cancer cells with altered driver genes versus wild-type cell lines using the Mann-Whitney U test. Drugs with a p-value less than 0.05 were considered as having potential for selective treatment. This process enabled us to identify drugs with a high likelihood of selectively targeting cancer cells with specific synthetic lethal gene pairs, thereby providing a promising avenue for personalized cancer therapy.
